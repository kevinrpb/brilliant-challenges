Let's see the image that the challenge presents. This one doesn't have a lot of logic/reasoning behind, let's just count triangles!

Let's be careful. Since the image is symmetric, we will count the triangles on one side and then double up. Let's find triangles on the 'left', starting by the most obvious ones:

Now lets count for those small two other triangles

And those other two a bit bigger

And those other two even bigger

![Geometric image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2019-04-07/2019-04-07_img_7.png)

And.... That's it. Not more triangles than the ones we counted (8!). So if we do the math for the other side, `we have 16 triangles`.
